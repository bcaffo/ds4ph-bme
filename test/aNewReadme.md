# What did I do? Did I do things? Let's find out!

So far, I've managed to:
1. Fork the course directory from bcaffo/ds4ph-bme
2. Create a directory called Test and creating readme.md within it using "/" when adding a new file
3. Write a readme file using **Markdown** *syntax*
4. ???
5. Profit

Am I doing this right?
