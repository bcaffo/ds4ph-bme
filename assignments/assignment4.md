
Please turn in the assignment as a single complied R markdown document. Include the Rmd and HTML files. 

* Download the first Kirb21 subject data [here](https://github.com/neuroconductor/kirby21.mricloud/blob/master/inst/visit_1/127/kirby_3_1_ax_283Labels_M2_corrected_stats.txt).  Use [this package](https://neuroconductor.org/package/MRIcloudT1volumetrics) to read in the first
subject. Calculate and report the intracranial volume: the sum of the level 1 type 1 volumes. 
* Read in the class data from here [https://github.com/bcaffo/ds4bme/blob/master/data/classInterests.txt](https://github.com/bcaffo/ds4bme/blob/master/data/classInterests.txt). Use ggplot to create bar plots of year and program. 
* Create a mosaic plot of the class data for year and program.
* Download the gene expression dataset from [here](https://github.com/jhu-advdatasci/2018/blob/master/data/GSE5859_exprs.csv). Information about the data can be found in the sample info [here](https://github.com/jhu-advdatasci/2018/blob/master/data/GSE5859_sampleinfo.csv). From the gene expression data matrix, subtract the rowmean from each row and the column mean from each column so that you have a new matrix that has been demeaned across both rows and columns. 
* Download the data from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhu-advdatasci/2018/master/data/KFF/healthcare-spending.csv). Create plots of healthcare spending versus time color coded by states.
* Refer to the previous data. Create a barplot of average health care spending by state.
