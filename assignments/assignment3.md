# Assignment 3

I. Write a function `mylag` that takes in a vector and a list of integers and returns a matrix with the oringal and lagged vectors. Make sure that it labels the columns. For example `mylag( c(1, 5, 8, 4), c(1, 3))` should return:
```
L0 L1 L3
1  NA NA
5  1  NA
8  5  NA
4  8  1
```
Make sure your function uses only basic R commands (R has a prewritten function that does this). Submit the function as the file `question1.R`.

II. Take the web page that you downloaded for your previous Assignment (the wikipedia page for Chewbacca) and read it into R. Count the number of lines in R. Return you code and the answer as a commment in `question2. R`. 

III. Write a function `Hogwarts` to determine what Hogwarts house a user is in. Your function should ask for a text response and then reply one of `Gryffindor`, `Hufflepuff`, `Ravenclaw` or `Slytherin`. It doesn't have to be super elaborate. Hint, here's some code to wait to receive text input in R. 
```
continue = TRUE

while (continue) {

  response = readline(prompt = "Enter response (q to quit) >")
  
  print(response)
  
  continue = (response != "q")
  
}
```
Put your function in `question3.R` (and similarly for the subsequent).

IV. Write a function `corner` that takes a matrix and a vector of two integers and returns the submatrix from that point to ther upper left. For example, if `A` is the matrix:
```
1 7 8 9
2 4 1 3
9 3 7 4
1 0 3 8
```
then `corner(a, c(2, 3))` should return the matrix:
```
1 7 8
2 4 1
```
Make sure that your function does some error checking. 

V. Similate 6,000 die rolls using `sample`. Put them in a matrix of size 1,000 x 6. Calculate the average of each row so that you now have a vector of 1,000 averages of 6 die rolls. Plot a histogram of the averages. Calculate the average of the averages. Calculate the variance of the averages.

VI. Write a function `birthday` that calcualtes the probability at least two people in a room of `n` people (input by the user) have the same birthday. [Here's the wikipedia article on the birthday problem ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem). Create a plot of the probability by the number of people in the room.

VII Write a function `ppv` where a user inputs the `sensitivity`, `specificity` and `prevalance` associate with a diagnostic test and gives the positive predictive value. [The formula can be found here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_and_negative_predictive_values).
