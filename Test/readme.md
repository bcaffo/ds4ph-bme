## Question 2

1. On github, I clicked the "Fork" button at https://github.com/bcaffo/ds4ph-bme.
2. At the forked directory, I clicked the "Clone or download" dropdown menu and copied the URL https://github.com/tylerjssmith/ds4ph-bme.git.
3. At the command line for my computer, I used `cd` to change to the directory that will be one level above the cloned repository.
4. At the command line, I ran `git clone https://github.com/tylerjssmith/ds4ph-bme.git`.
5. At the command line, I ran `cd ds4ph-bme; mkdir Test; cd Test; touch readme.md`.
6. At the command line, I ran `nano readme.md` and edited the file in nano.
