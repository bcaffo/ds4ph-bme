# What I have done  
First, I forked the course repository. 
Then I cloned this repository to my local RStudio Cloud. 
Then I created the directory "Test",  
Then I go to the directory and created the file "readme.md".  
Then I go back to the upper level directory and keep track of it and commit the changes.  
Then push my modified repository back.
