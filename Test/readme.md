# Assignment 1, Question 2

I forked the ds4ph-bme repo using the button on Github. Then, I used the terminal in Rsttudio Cloud to clone this forked repo 
and add a new repository called "Test". I then created this readme file in terminal as well. Then I committed and pushed these 
changes to Github, where I am now editing the readme file.
