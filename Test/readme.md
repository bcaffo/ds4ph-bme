# Title
## What I have done
<p> I click "fork" on the course repo to fork it to my Github</br>
Then I used the command in the picture to make Test directory and readme.md at local repo.<br>
Next, I commit the changes and push the changes to Github</p>
At last, I edited this README with markdown syntax, and  **commit the changes** .
