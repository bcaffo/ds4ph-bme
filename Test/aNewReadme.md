# What I have done:

1. Fork the course `repository`, create a directory `Test`, and add a markdown file `aNewReadme.md` to `Test`

2. Issue a pull request for the course repository

3. Create a new github repository called `ds4bmeTest` and a readme file
![respository ds4bmeTest](/Test/screenshots/assignment1_3.png)

4. Clone the `ds4bmeTest`, modified the readme file and push the changes back up to my repo

5. Create a simple webpage; commit it to my repo and serve the webpage using github pages

6. Create a branch for `ds4bmeTest` called `development` and add a file called `testing.md`
