# Assignment 1, part 1

## This is a description in markdown syntax of what I have done so far

I did the following steps:

1. Forked the course repository from **my Guthub account**. 
2. Created a folder called *Test*.
3. Added a markdown called aNewReadme.md to the folder *Test*.
4. Now I am editing this file using markdown syntax.
