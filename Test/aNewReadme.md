# Hello
## What I have done so far?

1. I have forked the class repository from Prof. Caffo. (from the button on the github website)
2. Created a new folder called "Test" in the forked repository under my Github account, using Github desktop to commit changes and push to Github
3. Added a new markdown file called "aNewReadme.md"
4. Now I'm here :)
