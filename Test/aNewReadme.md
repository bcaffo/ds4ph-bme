# Assignment 1
## Steps I have taken:


1. Forked the github course repository `ds4ph-bme` by clicking on **fork** on `bcaffo/ds4ph-bme` .
2. Created a directory in the forked repository by clicking on **Add file** and choosing **Create new file** ,then added the directory name `Test` followed by `/`.
3. Created the markdown file `aNewReadme.md` in the newly created directory by adding the name `aNewReadme.md` in the textbox after `Test/` , this created the markdown file  in the `Test` directory.
4. Edited the markdown file to include these steps .
5. Committed the markdown file  by clicking on **Commit new file** at the bottom.
