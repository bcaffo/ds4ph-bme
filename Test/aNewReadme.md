# Question 1

## What I have done: 
In order to fork the course repository, I opened the link of the course GitHub and clicked the 'Fork' button on the top right. 
As a result of this action, I could see the duplicated webpage of the course GitHub with the repository name of 'spark211/ds4ph-bme'. 

In order to create a directory called 'Test' and add a markdown file to the Test directory called 'aNewReadme.md', 
I simply typed 'Test' and 'aNewReadme.md' consecutively after 'ds4ph-bme'. Between each of them, there should be '/' included.
