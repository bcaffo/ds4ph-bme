3. Issue a pull request for the course repository. Create a screenshot of your pull request. Hand in the screenshot.
4. Create a new github repository called `ds4bmeTest`; add a readme file.

5. Download or create a simple webpage; commit it to your repository and serve the webpage using github pages.
6. Create a branch for your `ds4bmeTest` called `development`. Add a file called `testing.md`
