# Course communication
All course communcation will come be over the #ds4bme channel on the [ds4bme2019](https://ds4ph-bme.slack.com) slack channel. Invites to the group will be given in the first class.

# Grading
The course will involve three forms of evaluation: quizzes, homework and projects.

The final grade will be the average of the project, in class quiz grades and homework weighted equally.

The quizzes percentage will be calculated as: 

(X1 + ... + Xk) / (P1 + ... + PK) 

where the Xi and Pi are the student points and possible points on assessment i respectively.

The homework grade will be calculated in the same way.
