# Introduction

A github repo for the Data Science in Biomedical Engineering and Data Science for Public Health Courses.

Course location / time: Classes will be done asyncronously. Recorded lectures will be posted on the Teams site for the class. In addition, there will be two office hours / live lectures / live coding sessions per week on  Tuesdays and Thursdays. These live sessions are not required and will not be recorded. Students are welcome to attend 0, 1 or both. The two within a day will be highly redudant. However, they will be highly essential for most students in the class. In addition, zoom meetings with instructor are available on request. If you have a conflicting class(es), you should be able to take this class provided you can make some of the live lecture times. 

Times of live sessions
* 8:30 AM - 9:50 AM 
* 1:30 PM - 2:45 PM

TA office hours:
* 9:00 - 10:00 Friday

Course instructor: [Brian Caffo](www.bcaffo.com)

Course instructor and TA communication: [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ab2b41e73e5054ec0945f3cf946a54896%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=c0f7b3c4-71a1-46b4-8c0f-bdb732869de0&tenantId=9fa4f438-b1e6-473b-803f-86f8aedf0dec)

I cannot stress enought the need to be active on Teams for the  class. Much of the discussion will occur there. New announcements will be made there.

# Video conferencing links
Video conferencing links will be sent via the Teams site and initally emails to avoid zoom bombers.

# Grading: 
* There will be once weekly online form submissions (quizzes) / projects / assignments due Mondays at 5:00 PM, unless otherwise noted. These will be based on points and your percentage of total points will represent 70% of the grade. The specific format of the evalutation will be communicated each week.
* These can be handed in and amended anytime up until the due date
* There will be one capstone project that represents 30% of the total grade. This can be done in teams.
* Every evaluation is open book, open internet .... 
* You may not consult with fellow students on any quiz prortion of the assignment.
* You may consult with fellow students on any coding project or assigment (other than a quiz)
* All work submitted must be your own. Copying or plagiarism will be considered a breach of student conduct.
* If doing a team capstone project, seperate github submissions must be made and the role of each team member delineated in the readme file.
